# Proposed title: Methods matter: why most published enrichment analyses are wrong

Gene set enrichment analyses are a widely used and powerful class of analytical tools for summarising omics data.
Despite this, when performed improperly it can lead to biases and incorrect conclusions [1](Timmons et al, 2015).
The purpose of this study is to perform a survey of the use of contemporary enrichment analysis methods and the level of documentation in the literature.
We will collate a list of papers in PubMed Central (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) published in 2019 that have “enrichment analysis” and related terms. With each of these papers we will collect information:

* Pubmed Central ID

* Journal name

* Type of omics data

* Species

* Gene set library used

* Statistical test used

* Whether p-values were FDR corrected

* Software package used

* Versions of software and functional classifications were reported

* Code availability

* Whether a background gene set was used

* Whether assumptions are correctly applied

* Other notes (for example if there is no documentation of enrichment analysis).

Specifically we will be determining the presence of poor analytical practices in enrichment analysis in the contemporary literature.
By doing this, we hope to shed light on how researchers can avoid common pitfalls in enrichment analysis.

Also, we propose a range of best practices for performing and reporting functional enrichment analysis in the style of Minimum information about a microarray experiment (MIAME)[2](Brazma et al, 2001).
